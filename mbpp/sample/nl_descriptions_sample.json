    "[ANSWER]\nThe function `f` takes a single argument `x` and returns the result of `x + 1`. The logic implemented is very simple: it increments the input value by 1.\n\nDuring execution:\n1. In Step 1 (INPUT), the function is called with `x = 5`. The variable `x` is assigned the value 5.\n2. In Step 2 (RETURN), the function computes `x + 1`, which is `5 + 1 = 6`, and returns this value as `__return__`.\n\nThe final result is 6 because the function simply adds 1 to the input value (5), resulting in 6. The behavior is straightforward, with no conditional logic or loops, and the only variable `x` is used to compute the return value."
