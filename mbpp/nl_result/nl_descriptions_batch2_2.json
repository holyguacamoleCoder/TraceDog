    "nl": "The function `next_Power_Of_2` calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the input number `n`.\n\nAlgorithm and execution steps:\n1. The function starts with input `n = 17` and initializes `count = 0`.\n2. The first condition checks if `n` is already a power of 2 by verifying `n & (n - 1) == 0`. Since 17 is not a power of 2, this condition fails.\n3. The while loop begins, repeatedly right-shifting `n` (dividing by 2) and incrementing `count` until `n` becomes 0:\n   - First iteration: `n = 17 >> 1 = 8`, `count = 1`\n   - Second iteration: `n = 8 >> 1 = 4`, `count = 2`\n   - Third iteration: `n = 4 >> 1 = 2`, `count = 3`\n   - Fourth iteration: `n = 2 >> 1 = 1`, `count = 4`\n   - Fifth iteration: `n = 1 >> 1 = 0`, `count = 5`\n4. The loop exits when `n = 0`, and the function returns `1 << count`, which is `1 << 5 = 32`.\n\nVariable changes:\n- `n` starts at 17 and is halved each iteration until it reaches 0.\n- `count` increments by 1 for each bit position shifted, ending at 5.\n\nThe final result is 32 because:\n- The algorithm counts how many times we can halve the input number before reaching 0 (5 times for 17).\n- The next power of 2 is then calculated as 2 raised to this count plus 1 (2^5 = 32), which is the smallest power of 2 greater than 17."

    "nl": "The function `frequency` counts how many times a given element `x` appears in a list `a`.\n\nExecution steps:\n1. The function starts with input parameters: \n   - `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]` (the list to search)\n   - `x = 3` (the target element to count)\n2. A counter variable `count` is initialized to `0`.\n3. The function then iterates through each element `i` in the list `a`:\n   - For `i = 1`: Not equal to `x` (3), so `count` remains `0`\n   - For `i = 2`: Not equal to `x`, `count` remains `0`\n   - For `i = 2`: Not equal to `x`, `count` remains `0`\n   - For `i = 3`: Equal to `x`, so `count` increments to `1`\n   - For `i = 3`: Equal to `x`, so `count` increments to `2`\n   - For `i = 3`: Equal to `x`, so `count` increments to `3`\n   - For `i = 4`: Not equal to `x`, `count` remains `3`\n4. After processing all elements, the function returns the final `count` value of `3`.\n\nThe final result is `3` because the number `3` appears three times in the input list. This is a simple linear search algorithm that counts occurrences by examining each element in sequence."
