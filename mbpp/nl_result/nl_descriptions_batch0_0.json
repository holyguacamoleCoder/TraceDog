The second loop replaces non-positive numbers and numbers larger than `n` with `1`:\n   - `arr[0] = 1`, `arr[1] = 1`, `arr[2] = 1`, `arr[5] = 1`\n6. The third loop marks present numbers by adding `n` to their corresponding indices:\n   - For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates `(arr[i] - 1) % n` to get the correct index and adds `n` to that index's value.\n   - This results in the array becoming `[31, 1, 1, 1, 11, 1]` after marking.\n7. The fourth loop checks for the first index where the value is less than or equal to `n`:\n   - At index `1`, `arr[1] = 1 <= 6`, so the function returns `i + 1 = 2`.\n\nThe algorithm works by:\n1. Ensuring `1` exists (otherwise it's the answer)\n2. Cleaning the array to contain only relevant numbers\n3. Using the array indices to mark presence of numbers\n4.
