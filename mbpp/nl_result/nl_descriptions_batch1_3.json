The final result maintains the length-based order while preserving the relative order of sublists with equal lengths (stable sort property).\n\nThe function works by:\n1. First applying Python's default sort (lexicographical order)\n2. Then applying a secondary sort using the `key=len` parameter to sort by sublist length\n3. Returning the list sorted first by length, then by lexicographical order for equal-length sublists\n\nThe final output is `[['DBMS'], ['python'], ['SQL', 'HTML'], ['java', 'C', 'C++']]` because:\n- The two single-element sublists come first (sorted alphabetically as 'DBMS' before 'python')\n- Followed by the two-element sublist ['SQL', 'HTML']\n- Finally the three-element sublist ['java', 'C', 'C++']"

The `avg_calc` function is called to compute the mean of the list:\n   - The mean is calculated as `(5 + 9 + 10 + 15 + 6 + 4) / 6 = 8.166666666666666`.\n5. The standard deviation `sd` is initialized to `0.0`.\n6. For each element in the list, the function:\n   - Computes the squared difference between the element and the mean.\n   - Accumulates these squared differences into `sd`:\n     - For `5`: `(5 - 8.166666666666666)**2 = 10.027777777777773` → `sd = 10.027777777777773`\n     - For `9`: `(9 - 8.166666666666666)**2 = 0.6944444444444446` → `sd = 10.722222222222218`\n     - For `10`: `(10 - 8.166666666666666)**2 = 3.3611111111111107` → `sd = 14.083333333333332`\n     - For `15`: `(15 - 8.166666666666666)**2 = 46.69444444444444` → `sd = 60.777777777777786`\n     - For `6`: `(6 - 8.166666666666666)**2 = 4.694444444444445` → `sd = 65.47222222222223`\n     - For `4`: `(4 - 8.166666666666666)**2 = 17.36111111111111` → `sd = 82.83333333333334`\n7. The standard deviation is then computed by taking the square root of the accumulated squared differences divided by `n-1` (degrees of freedom):\n   - `sd = sqrt(82.83333333333334 / 5) = 4.070217029430577`.\n8. The function returns the computed standard deviation `4.070217029430577`.\n\nThis process follows the standard formula for sample standard deviation, which involves calculating the mean, summing squared deviations from the mean, and normalizing by the degrees of freedom before taking the square root."
