    "nl": "The function `generate_matrix` creates an n x n matrix filled with numbers in a spiral order starting from 1.\n\nExecution steps:\n1. The function starts with input `n = 2` and initializes a 2x2 matrix filled with zeros: `[[0, 0], [0, 0]]`.\n2. Variables `row_st`, `row_ed`, `col_st`, and `col_ed` are set to define the current spiral boundaries (initially covering the entire matrix).\n3. The variable `current` is initialized to 1, representing the next number to be placed in the matrix.\n4. The spiral filling process begins:\n   - First, fill the top row from left to right (columns `col_st` to `col_ed`):\n     - `matrix[0][0] = 1`, `current` becomes 2\n     - `matrix[0][1] = 2`, `current` becomes 3\n   - Move `row_st` down by 1 (now 1) and fill the right column from top to bottom:\n     - `matrix[1][1] = 3`, `current` becomes 4\n   - Move `col_ed` left by 1 (now 0) and fill the bottom row from right to left:\n     - `matrix[1][0] = 4`, `current` becomes 5\n   - Move `row_ed` up by 1 (now 0) and `col_st` right by 1 (now 1), but no more elements need filling as `current > n*n`.\n5. The final matrix is returned as `[[1, 2], [4, 3]]`.\n\nThe algorithm works by progressively filling the outer layers of the matrix in a spiral pattern while adjusting the boundaries after each side is completed. For n=2, this results in one complete spiral layer filling all elements."

    "nl": "The function `generate_matrix` creates an n x n matrix filled with numbers in a spiral order starting from 1.\n\nAlgorithm and Execution:\n1. Initialization:\n   - Creates an n x n matrix filled with zeros (for n=7, a 7x7 matrix)\n   - Sets initial boundaries: row_st=0, row_ed=6, col_st=0, col_ed=6\n   - Starts with current=1\n\n2. Spiral Filling Process:\n   - First fills the top row left to right (1-7), then increments row_st\n   - Fills right column top to bottom (8-13), then decrements col_ed\n   - Fills bottom row right to left (14-19), then decrements row_ed\n   - Fills left column bottom to top (20-24), then increments col_st\n   - Repeats the process moving inward with updated boundaries\n\n3. Variable Changes:\n   - Boundaries contract after each full spiral:\n     row_st increases, row_ed decreases\n     col_st increases, col_ed decreases\n   - Current increments by 1 for each filled cell\n   - The process continues until current > n*n (49 for n=7)\n\n4. Final Result:\n   - The spiral pattern is achieved by systematically:\n     1) Filling outer layers first\n     2) Moving inward with each iteration\n     3) Adjusting boundaries to create the spiral path\n   - For n=7, the matrix completes 3 full spirals before reaching the center at 49\n\nThe function efficiently creates a spiral matrix by maintaining and updating boundary markers while filling cells in a consistent clockwise pattern."

    "nl": "The function `max_sub_array_sum` implements Kadane's algorithm to find the length of the maximum sum contiguous subarray in a given array.\n\nExecution steps:\n1. Initialization:\n   - `max_so_far` is set to the smallest possible integer (-∞)\n   - `max_ending_here` tracks the current subarray sum (initialized to 0)\n   - `start` and `end` track the boundaries of the maximum subarray\n   - `s` marks the potential start of a new subarray\n\n2. Iteration through the array:\n   - For each element at index `i`:\n     a. Add the element to `max_ending_here`\n     b. If this sum exceeds `max_so_far`, update `max_so_far` and record the subarray boundaries (`start` and `end`)\n     c. If the sum becomes negative, reset `max_ending_here` to 0 and move the potential start (`s`) to the next index\n\n3. Key variable changes:\n   - At i=0 (value=-2): \n     - `max_ending_here` becomes -2\n     - `max_so_far` updates to -2\n     - Reset to 0 when sum goes negative\n   - At i=2 (value=4):\n     - `max_ending_here` becomes 4\n     - `max_so_far` updates to 4\n     - Subarray starts at index 2\n   - At i=6 (value=5):\n     - `max_ending_here` becomes 7 (4 + -1 + -2 + 1 + 5)\n     - `max_so_far` updates to 7\n     - Subarray end extends to index 6\n\n4. Final result:\n   - The maximum sum subarray is from index 2 to 6: [4, -1, -2, 1, 5]\n   - The length is calculated as `end - start + 1 = 6 - 2 + 1 = 5`\n\nThe algorithm efficiently tracks the maximum sum subarray by only keeping relevant information (current sum and maximum found so far) and adjusting the subarray boundaries when beneficial."
