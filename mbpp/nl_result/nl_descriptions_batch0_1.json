The input string is 'PART OF THE JOURNEY IS PART' with length 27.\n2. A 27x27 matrix `L` is initialized with zeros to store intermediate results.\n3. The diagonal of `L` is set to 1 since each single character is a palindrome of length 1.\n4. The algorithm fills the matrix for subsequences of increasing lengths (from 2 to 27):\n   - For each subsequence length `cl`, it checks all possible starting positions `i` and ending positions `j`.\n   - If the characters at positions `i` and `j` match:\n     - For length 2, it sets `L[i][j] = 2`.\n     - For longer lengths, it adds 2 to the result of the inner subsequence (`L[i+1][j-1]`).\n   - If characters don't match, it takes the maximum of either excluding the left character or the right character (`max(L[i][j-1], L[i+1][j])`).\n5. Key observations during execution:\n   - The first significant palindrome found is of length 3 at positions (4,7) for the substring \"T T\".\n   - The length increases to 5, 7, and finally 9 for the subsequence \"PART...PART\".\n6. The final result `L[0][26] = 9` represents the longest palindromic subsequence length.\n\nThis dynamic programming approach efficiently builds up the solution by combining results from smaller subproblems, avoiding the exponential complexity of a naive recursive solution."
