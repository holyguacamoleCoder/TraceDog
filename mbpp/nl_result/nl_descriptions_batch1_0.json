The function initializes `count` and `sum` to 0, and `mp` as a defaultdict with default value 0.\n2. `mp[0]` is set to 1 to handle the base case where the sum of digits equals the substring length (0 initially).\n3. The function iterates over each character in the string:\n   - For each character, it converts it to an integer and adds it to `sum`.\n   - It then checks if `(sum - (i + 1))` exists in `mp` (where `i + 1` is the current substring length). If it does, it increments `count` by the value stored in `mp`.\n   - Finally, it increments the count for `(sum - (i + 1))` in `mp`.\n4. The function returns the total `count` after processing all characters.\n\nVariable changes:\n- `sum` accumulates the sum of digits as the function processes each character.\n- `count` increases whenever a valid substring is found (sum of digits equals substring length).\n- `mp` keeps track of how many times each `(sum - substring length)` value has been encountered.\n\nFinal result (12) is computed because:\n- The function identifies 12 substrings where the sum of digits equals the substring length. For example:\n  - \"1\" (sum=1, length=1)\n  - \"11\" (sum=2, length=2)\n  - \"101\" (sum=2, length=3) → sum - length = -1, which was seen before\n  - And other similar substrings.\n\nThe algorithm efficiently tracks valid substrings using prefix sums and a hash map to avoid recomputation."

An array `msis` of size `n` is initialized with zeros to store intermediate maximum sums.\n4. Each element in `msis` is initially set to the corresponding value in `arr`:\n   - `msis = [3, 4, 5, 10]`\n5. For each element at index `i` (from 1 to n-1), the function checks all previous elements `j` (from 0 to i-1):\n   - If `arr[i] > arr[j]` and `msis[i] < msis[j] + arr[i]`, then `msis[i]` is updated to `msis[j] + arr[i]`:\n     - For `i=1, j=0`: `msis[1]` becomes `3 + 4 = 7`\n     - For `i=2, j=0`: `msis[2]` becomes `3 + 5 = 8`\n     - For `i=2, j=1`: `msis[2]` becomes `7 + 5 = 12`\n     - For `i=3, j=0`: `msis[3]` becomes `3 + 10 = 13`\n     - For `i=3, j=1`: `msis[3]` becomes `7 + 10 = 17`\n     - For `i=3, j=2`: `msis[3]` becomes `12 + 10 = 22`\n6. After processing all elements, the maximum value in `msis` is found by iterating through it:\n   - `max` is updated to the highest value in `msis`, which is `22`.\n7. The function returns `22` as the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence.\n\nThe algorithm works by building up the solution incrementally, ensuring that each element's maximum sum is calculated based on all valid preceding elements, resulting in an optimal solution through dynamic programming."
