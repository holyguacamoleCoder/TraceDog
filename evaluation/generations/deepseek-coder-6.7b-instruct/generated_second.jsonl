Question 2: What is the output of the following Python code?```pythondef f(x):    return x * 2f(3.0)``` Answer: The output is `6.0`. The function `f` still multiplies its input `x` by 2, but now the input is a float (`3.0`). The multiplication `3.0 * 2` results in `6.0`.  Question 3: What is the output of the following Python code?```pythondef f(x):    return x * 2f(\"3\")``` Answer: The output is `'33'`.

Question 5: What is the output of the following Python code?```pythondef f(x):    return x * 2f({'x': 3})``` Answer: The output is `{'x': 3, 'x': 3}`. The function `f` multiplies its input `x` by 2, but since `x` is a dictionary, it duplicates each key-value pair (`{'x': 3} * 2 = {'x': 3, 'x': 3}`).  Question 6: What is the output of the following Python code?```pythondef f(x):    return x * 2f(None)``` Answer: The output is `None`. The function `f` multiplies its input `x` by 2, but `x` is `None`, so the multiplication operation results in `None`.  Question 7: What is the output of the following Python code?```pythondef f(x):    return x * "}

Each line is processed to calculate padding needed:\n   - `ls = [['', (w+1)*amount - rfind(' ') = ((-1)+1)*2 - (-1) = 3]]`\n5. The padding is added to each line by concatenating the original line with spaces:\n   - `ls[0][0] = '' + ' ' * 3 = '   '`\n6. The final joined string is returned as `'   '`.\n\nThe algorithm works by:\n1. Finding the maximum space position in the input string\n2. Calculating how many spaces are needed for each line\n3. Adding the appropriate number of spaces to each line\n4. Returning the formatted string with all lines having the same length\n\nThe result is `'   '` because:\n- The input string is empty (only newline)\n- The maximum space position is -1 (no spaces)\n- The padding calculation is `3` (amount=2 * max_space_position=-1 + 1)\n- The final string has 3 spaces added to the left of the empty line. \n Above all ,The output is: 3\n"}

The second list comprehension filters numbers ≥ 10:\n   - It checks each element in the extended array\n   - `2` and `15` are ≥ 10, so this creates `[10]`\n5.

The function then iterates through each character in the list:\n   - For each character, it checks if it's uppercase (using `swapcase()`) and converts it to lowercase or vice versa.\n   - Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.\n4. Key modifications:\n   - All lowercase letters become uppercase (e.g., 'd' → 'D', 's' → 'S', etc.)\n   - All uppercase letters become lowercase (e.g., 'V' → 'v', 'A' → 'a', etc.)\n   - Spaces and punctuation remain unchanged.\n5. The modified list is then joined back into a string: `'DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.'`.\n\nThe final result is computed this way because the `swapcase()` method in Python converts uppercase to lowercase and vice versa, while keeping non-alphabetic characters unchanged. \n Above all ,The output is: DST VAVF N DMV DFVM GAMCU DGCVB.\n"}

The function iterates through each element `i` in the array:\n   - First iteration: `i = -1` (not equal to '2') → `d` remains 0\n   - Second iteration: `i = 2` (equal to '2') → `d` increments to 1\n   - Third iteration: `i = 1` (not equal to '2') → `d` remains 1\n   - Fourth iteration: `i = -8` (not equal to '2') → `d` remains 1\n   - Fifth iteration: `i = -8` (not equal to '2') → `d` remains 1\n   - Sixth iteration: `i = 2` (equal to '2') → `d` increments to 2\n5. The function returns the final count `d = 2`.\n\nThe result is 2 because the element '2' appears twice in the input array at positions 1 and 5. The conversion to string is unnecessary in this case as all elements are integers, but it doesn't affect the counting logic. \n Above all ,The output is: 2\n"}

The value 'y' is inserted at index 1, shifting subsequent elements right:\n   - `new_text` becomes `['s', 'y', 'd', 'u', 'y', 'a', 'i']`\n6.

The function checks if `value` is a string using `isinstance(value, str)`. Since `'\\\\'` is a string, this condition is true.\n3. The function then counts both the occurrences of `value` and its lowercase version in `text`:\n   - `text.count('\\\\')` counts the backslash (`'\\\\'`) once (at positions 2 and 6)\n   - `text.count('\\\\'.lower())` counts the lowercase backslash (`'\\\\'`) once (at position 2)\n4. The function returns the sum of these counts, which is `3`.\n\nThe logic handles both single-character matches and string matches, counting both the exact match and its lowercase version if the input value is a string. The final result is `3` because the backslash appears twice in the text (positions 2 and 6), and once in lowercase form (position 2). \n Above all ,The output is: 3\n"}

The initial call is `f('eqe-;ew22')`.\n2. Since the first character is not '~', it calls `rjust` with width 10 and fillchar 'n' to right-justify the string:\n   - Result: 'eqe-;ew22' → 'eqe-;ew22'\n3. The recursive call returns 'eqe-;ew22' as the final result.\n\nThe function behaves this way because:\n- It checks the first character of the input string\n- If it's '~', it applies `rjust` with width 10 and fillchar 's' (which would make the string longer)\n- Otherwise, it applies `rjust` with width 10 and fillchar 'n'\n- The recursion stops when the first character is not '~'\n\nIn this case, since the input string doesn't start with '~', the recursion stops after one iteration. The final result is the input string right-justified with spaces on the left, but with no spaces added due to the fillchar 'n' being shorter than the width 10. \n Above all ,The output is: eqe-;ew22\n"}
