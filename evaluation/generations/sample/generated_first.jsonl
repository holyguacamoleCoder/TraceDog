The input list `nums = [1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1]` is provided.\n2. An empty list `output` is initialized to store the frequency-number pairs.\n3. The function iterates through each number `n` in `nums`:\n   - For `n = 1`:\n     - Counts occurrences of 1 in `nums` (3 times)\n     - Appends `(3, 1)` to `output`\n   - For `n = 3`:\n     - Counts occurrences of 3 in `nums` (2 times)\n     - Appends `(2, 3)` to `output`\n4. The `output` list becomes `[(3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)]`.\n5.
